		<h2>Woof! I'm Luke.</h2>
		<p>February 27, 2014</p>

			Today, I found my <strong>forever home</strong>! There is lots of room and I can sleep wherever I want. I had an accident on the carpet and momma wasn't too happy, but <u>I promise I will learn to go in the right spot!</u> I sleep a lot and momma loves to cuddle with me.
		</p>
		<p>
			My favorite time of day is meal time! It happens three times a day and <em>it makes my tummy so happy.</em> After meal time, I play with my toys then take a nap. When I sleep, I dream of running around a large field and playing with other doggies. Momma says my dreams are so vivid that I actually move my legs in my sleep.

		<h2>My First Play Date</h2>
		<p>April 20th, 2014</p>
		<p>Today, momma took me to the dog park for the first time. I had no idea there were so many other doggies in the world! I had so much fun meeting new friends and chasing them around.
